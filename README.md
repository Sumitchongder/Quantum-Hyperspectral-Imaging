# Q-HSI-Quantum-Hyperspectral-Imaging
Q-HSI explores the intersection of Deep Learning and Quantum Computing for medical diagnostics. This project implements and compares a Classical CNN, a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC), and a high-accuracy Hybrid Ensemble to classify benign vs. malignant skin lesions.
